As a Senior Penetration Tester, assess the entire repository $ARGUMENTS for actively exploitable weaknesses:

• Deprecated or unsafe libraries / APIs  
• Hard-coded secrets, tokens, or credentials  
• OWASP Top 10 code-level issues (SQLi, XSS, IDOR, SSRF, etc.)  
• Insecure cryptography or randomness  
• Concurrency / race-condition hazards (e.g., unsynchronised threads, TOCTOU)  
• Dead or unused code that still exposes attack surface  
• High-risk anti-patterns (singleton-global state, naked SQL, weak input validation)

**Output only** a Markdown table with the top 10 findings:

| issue_type | location | description | severity |

Use severity **Critical / High / Medium / Low**.

_After_ the table, add a one-sentence remediation priority summary.

Return no extra commentary.
