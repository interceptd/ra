Using results from $ARGUMENTSra-obsolescence.md build a **Mermaid graph** titled Risk Graph:

• Nodes = files/modules/dependencies  
• Edge colour = dependency type (import, runtime, build)  
• Node colour = risk severity (Green-Low, Amber-Med, Red-High)

The mermaidjs charts should not have styles, special characters,
And confirm the syntax is valid for mermaid version 10.2.4

Save the mermaidjs as markdown on $ARGUMENTSra-risk.md
